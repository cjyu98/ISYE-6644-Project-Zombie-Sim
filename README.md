# ISYE 6644 - Zombie Infection Simulation
Authors: Min Kook Cho, Rithikaa Madhavan, Carmen Yu
Created for ISYE 6644 Summer 2024.

# Description
Using the EpiModel package in R, the goal of the project was to simulate a rapid infection across a dynamic network model similar to a zombie outbreak. Models were based on the Susceptible-Infected (SI) and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models in epidemiology. Scenarios where a cure and vaccination interventions were also explored.

A full breakdown and results are captured in the project pdf.

# Code Overview
The overall project is captured in a R notebook, in [sim_init.Rmd](main/sim_init.Rmd).
